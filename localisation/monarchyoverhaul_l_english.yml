monarchyoverhaul.1.title:0 "For King and Country"
monarchyoverhaul.1.desc:0 "Hello! Welcome to the mod. If you're not new to this mod in particular, you may know how the files of it mostly make playing this with other mods that alters the countries, in one way or another, is almost impossible; but still, it could be a very nice add-on to the game and should be able to run with other mods without major problems or crashes. For this purpose, the mod won't add it's content directly into the files, that may conflict with vanilla. Instead, the leaders, gfx, ideas, events and decisions will be loaded up into the game after it's started, securing compatibility with more mods and assuring further updates, that were hard to make as the game added more and more content, (almost) making the mod to be discontinued."
monarchyoverhaul.1.a:0 "Oh, ok, thanks."
monarchyoverhaul.2.title:0 "Better or Special Historical Flavor"
monarchyoverhaul.2.desc:0 "Hello there again! As this mod is being activated, it's now being asked to you whether the vanilla game 'Historical Mistakes' should be corrected or improved, according to what this mod has as coding. This event will fix Leaders, Flags, Ideologies and activate some events that will or will not change the course of your game. This action is not recomended if you're playing with mods that have their own flavor or alters the game's initial campaign; even less, if it is an alternate history scenario. Reminder: Some flags may already been altered by the standard game files."
monarchyoverhaul.2.a:0 "Yeah, i'll take it, thanks."
monarchyoverhaul.2.b:0 "No, thank you, it's better not."
monarchyoverhaul.3.title:0 "New Nations and Formables"
monarchyoverhaul.3.desc:0 "As of this mod's settings, it's also up to you, the player, to choose to add up the new formable tags and/or add cores of new nations in the main map. If you're playing this mod with more nations added, be aware of possible conflicting same-tag confusions within the game. The cosmetic tags are set to be unique, but not for releasable nations. It's not recomended to load this content if such problem is possible to happen, or you may want to deactivate the nations in the decisions tab, that will allow you to choose the nations/regions you'll want new tags on."
monarchyoverhaul.3.a:0 "New Nations? Cool"
monarchyoverhaul.3.b:0 "Nah, it may mess up my game."
monarchyoverhaul.4.title:0 "Where the crown never ruled"
monarchyoverhaul.4.desc:0 "This event is meant to set the rule for nations that never had a Monarchy as their form of Government, or, if they did, was under colonial rule. In this mod, generic leaders won't be added, as there are no generic Monarchs, nor Princes. The Monarchist Ideology, then, cannot be applied to a nation without a claimant on the same way the rest of the ideologies do it. If a nation without a set Monarch or pretender, it will enter a Regency, which the mod allows the nations that had no Monarch nor Pretender set to elect their own, as it would probably happen in real life, if a new nation is installing, instead of restoring, a Monarchy. If the player chooses to play a nation without a Monarch from the start, you may achieve the ideology either way, but the main event will open the list, if you so choose, to elect the Monarch to take the Crown of your nation among Princes, Dukes and Nobles added in the game."
monarchyoverhaul.4.a:0 "Oh, that's... nice..."
monarchyoverhaul.5.title:0 "Monarchist Literature"
monarchyoverhaul.5.desc:0 "In a time when the political situation can only be described as chaotic and dangerous to the future of human kind, a counter balance idealism started to rise among some intelectuals. Opposing to the Totalitarian rethoric of Fascism in it's many forms, appealing to the democratic ideals of liberty, promoting socialist views by praising actions of charity. These ideologists, however, aren't new to the political debate. They are Monarchists, the same who still, in many nations, or in loyal support for their Crown or struggling to see the heir of a defunct throne to be restored to power. They preach a formation of a Government that is under constant supervision of an 'higher order'. Unlike their ideological counterparts, they seem to be pretty united under their goal. Many invoke the idea of religion as a basis for a Monarchy, others ignore such aspect, stating and fundamenting their ideals on facts and observation. They view the role of the Monarch as a bastion of stability and national unity. All sorts of books on the matter are now being translated, published and republished all over the World. Monarchists as individuals, exist in many ways. Many only want to see their Monarch strenghtened in Power and influence; others want to bring back the Royal institutions to the State, while some go further enough to suggest replacing the Republican Form of Government for a Monarchical one even in nations that can only barely link their connection to a Monarchy in the form of their Colonial Rulers, but surprising as it is, they're gaining strenght..."
monarchyoverhaul.5.a:0 "What these idiots are thinking? Ban these writings!"
monarchyoverhaul.5.b:0 "If political threats are many... this could be the lesser of evils..."
monarchyoverhaul.5.c:0 "This is a product of genious minds..."
monarchyoverhaul.6.title:0 "Where is our Crown?"
monarchyoverhaul.6.desc:0 "In a surprising event, probably not seen in such a scale, large demonstrations were made across the nation. Their demand? A Crown for the nation. As it is known, protesters were acting to promote the idea of installing a Monarchy in our nation. Despite the only link to a Monarchy we have is the period of being a subject, these people or forget the old wars of independence or activelly praise the ones who remained loyal to the Monarchy and fought against the revolutionaries. They are united on the belief that a Republic is flawed and it will lead to tyranny of endemic corruption. They suggest the replacement of a presidential system to a Monarchy, using Europe as an example, sometimes praising their heritage and linking a Monarchy to a National Identity that, according to them, they're lacking. But as no Prince leads the demonstrations, they shout in unity: Where is our Crown?"
monarchyoverhaul.6.a:0 "Concerning..."
monarchyoverhaul.7.title:0 "Imperial Nostalgia"
monarchyoverhaul.7.desc:0 "As they gain strenght, the Monarchists once again have shown up in the political scene to promote their cause. They do, now, however, appeal to the nation's past, praising and resurrecting much of it's History, remembering Monarchs of foreign dominions as their own. With or without disregard for the national sentiment all are expected to have, they still look back with good eyes, making good looking of many characters of colonial rule as they were part of this building national project. It's hard to say how much and what would be if this group reaches up to power..."
monarchyoverhaul.7.a:0 "They really put the 'Crown' above the Nation..."
monarchyoverhaul.8.title:0 "A King for the People"
monarchyoverhaul.8.desc:0 "For a while, the idea of making a Monarchy out of the current Government's institutions came into the minds of many, from intelectuals to peasants. Initially ignored, the Monarchists made their way into the public view and gained their sympathy. Of course, the support for the installation of a Monarchy isn't unanimous, with many fiercely opposing the idea. Still, it's undeniable that they're now a majority within our nation and the Government may lose it's support and stability if they don't hear to these claims."
monarchyoverhaul.8.a:0 "We'll have to reach a compromise..."
monarchyoverhaul.8.b:0 "Suppress them at all costs!"
monarchyoverhaul.9.title:0 "Royalist Coup"
monarchyoverhaul.9.desc:0 "Despite major efforts, all of them proved out to be worthless. The Monarchists continued to grow in popularity and numbers. The people resorted to civil disobedience and the military no longer protects the government from any actions against it, what became widespread even in the most loyal and patriotic factions of the armed forces. With this scenario, many groups, with the support and acquiescence of the army, took over the main public buildings and proclaimed the formation of a Regency, stating that 'The King will come!', leaving the remnant Government out of the picture and unable to react in any way. The country is theirs now."
monarchyoverhaul.9.a:0 "Long live the King..."
monarchyoverhaul.10.title:0 "Regency Agreed"
monarchyoverhaul.10.desc:0 "Unable to contain the spread of the monarchist ideology and it's rethoric, while also fearing for the rise of any other group with fascist or communist or dictatorial aspirations, the Government itself has chosen the lesser of evils and took the initiative. The Constitution was revoked and the nation declared the creation of a Monarchy, with the Monarch yet to be chosen by the Congress."
monarchyoverhaul.10.a:0 "All hail to the Crown!"
monarchyoverhaul.11.title:0 "The Monarchy Restoration"
monarchyoverhaul.11.desc:0 "In the past, our nation in particular, had as a form of government a Monarchy. This period in our history never went away in the minds of some. A few still, to this day, hope to see the Crown ruling the nation again. Although it's popularity is questionable, pretenders and monarchist factions are getting some voice in the political scheme, which is likely to grow in the views of intelectuals and commoners alike."
monarchyoverhaul.11.a:0 "Dreamers, i'd say..."
monarchyoverhaul.12.title:0 "Monarchists in Politics"
monarchyoverhaul.12.desc:0 "Initially restricted to minor and scattered groups of intelectuals, the idea of a Monarchical Restoration came into Parliament, as some politicians abided to the idea and new ones with a previous public opinion about it got elected. For now, it's nothing of major concern, but this is a sign that, at least, these ideas are spreading in the streets and may, by now, also spread by the voice of Congress, if some politicians are up to endorse the idea..."
monarchyoverhaul.12.a:0 "They're truly gaining strenght..."
monarchyoverhaul.13.title:0 "Restore the Monarchy"
monarchyoverhaul.13.desc:0 "Following the surprising rise in influence and popularity of monarchist sympathizers, many of them made their way into the Government itself. Now, there's absolute certainty that the majority of the people are indeed supportive of the Monarchy, as many royalists in lower and higher chambers began to form coalitions and the pretender gaining more and more popularity among the people. With this reality, local leaders put to act the reformation of the Government into a Monarchy, similar to the one of the past, inviting the heir to the throne to take oath to the Constitution they're yet to make, if such bill pass..."
monarchyoverhaul.13.a:0 "If the people wants so... make it be..."
monarchyoverhaul.13.b:0 "Nonsense! This is a Coup! Impeach and arrest those responsible for this action!"
monarchyoverhaul.14.title:0 "The Heir to the Throne"
monarchyoverhaul.14.desc:0 "As the fringe monarchist coalitions begin to grow in influence and organization, many soon rallied to the Head of our Noble House, paying homage to him and praising the ancestors of his that once ruled the nation. His public appearences became more and more popular, as well as more frequent, adding to the popularity of the Monarchist cause."
monarchyoverhaul.14.a:0 "A truly influential leader, for sure..."
monarchyoverhaul.14.b:0 "Exile him and arrest the leaders!"
monarchyoverhaul.15.title:0 "Expanding Royal Powers"
monarchyoverhaul.15.desc:0 "Although our nation does not outstand the normal form of Monarchy, on which many rely on the King instead of politicians, it is not different for us. With popularity, our Monarch is the strongest and most influential piece of the Government for all classes, specially the lower ones. Despite these facts, unusual debates came in to parliament recently. Some propose that the powers of elected officials and the beaurocracy are to be reduced and given, or at least, restored, to the Crown. Strange, at first, but definetelly a debate that will go on for a while."
monarchyoverhaul.15.a:0 "I see no problem at all..."
monarchyoverhaul.16.title:0 "Pressure for Royal action"
monarchyoverhaul.16.desc:0 "Since debates around the role of the King in our Government began all over again, those who are loyal and support the Monarchy unconditionally are now taking the streets, public places and organizing many demonstrations. Likely due to their distrust in Parliamentary sovereignty, these people are rallying around the Monarchy in hope of a stable and responsible government, that, as they insist, the politicians have only failed them. Support for the Crown to take control is concerning, to say the least, but such trust may be used to change their course of action if the monarch is to make a public statement on the matter."
monarchyoverhaul.16.a:0 "Let's see what the Crown has to say..."
monarchyoverhaul.17.title:0 "The Crown supports the Royalists"
monarchyoverhaul.17.desc:0 "Gaining strenght on a daily basis, the Monarchists still aim for a strong Royal rule over our nation. This may not mean the dismissal of parliament and a dictatorship of the Crown, but it's known that they do, for sure, support a far strong royal government. When the Royalty itself had to take a position on the matter, our Monarch supported their actions, stating that the trust of their people would be carried as a sacred principle if the democratic institutions and the Law are to expand the role of the Monarchy and that they're ready to assume such duties. This positioning made many politicians afraid of what could come, while heavily strenghtening the Royalist factions within Parliament."
monarchyoverhaul.17.a:0 "What King would miss the chance of Restoration?"
monarchyoverhaul.17.b:0 "We cannot allow this to be the death of the Regime!"
monarchyoverhaul.18.title:0 "Your Majesty's Government"
monarchyoverhaul.18.desc:0 "With a long lasting and turbulent agitation, the Monarchists have finally won. The Parliament and remaining politicians passed many reforms, acts and decrees, transfering many Powers of State to the nominal or direct control of the Monarch. Some politicians resigned in protest, but no matter their position, the Government now will center around the Monarchy it sustains. In a public speach, the Royal family and it's staff announced that they won't disappoint the people who gave them this vote of confidence, as well as obeying the Law and playing the role a Monarch should always play, that of popular devotion."
monarchyoverhaul.18.a:0 "Long live the King!"
monarchyoverhaul.19.title:0 "Parliament dissolved"
monarchyoverhaul.19.desc:0 "When the Crown announced it's support for the many Monarchist factions appealing for a stronger royal rule and the strenghtening of the role of the monarch, the relations between the Crown and Parliament soured in a matter of days. Some politicians started to suggest the idea of abolishing the Monarchy altogether, what was recieved with anger by the people and no matter the efforts made to suppress the royalists within parliament and movements supporting them, the situation escalated. With the Government gaining the absolute hate of the people and royal support an all time high, it's dissolution was announced today. Legal or not, the monarch took charge and dismissed most of anti-monarchist forces on the nation, seizing the beaurocracy, responding to the demands of the people to strenghten the nation."
monarchyoverhaul.19.a:0 "Your Majesty, as always, made the right choice."
monarchyoverhaul.20.title:0 "The Monarchy Restored!"
monarchyoverhaul.20.desc:0 "As time passed, the memories of the Crown slowly began to settle on the minds of only the oldest or enthusiasts. Voices defending the old government existed since the last monarch left our lands. However, in recent years, supported by intelectuals, ambitious politicians and traditional figures, the political situation changed rapidly along with the support for the return of Royal rule coming from the people in the streets. All of this finally allowed the restoration of the Monarchy in our nation, as the rightful ruler today took the crown upon it's head."
monarchyoverhaul.20.a:0 "All Hail to Your Majesty!"
monarchyoverhaul.21.title:0 "The Chinese Monarchy"
monarchyoverhaul.21.desc:0 "With thousands of years of History, the Chinese civilization stood at the top of the world during it's many years, witnessing the rise and fall of Empires, handling many cicles of turmoil, instability as well as golden ages during it's Imperial rule. In 1911, the Xinhai Revolution deposed the last Emperor, now in Manchuria, Puyi. In 1915, a last attempt of saving the Monarchy in China was made by Yuan Shikai with it's short-lived Chinese Empire. Today, the Republic envisioned by Sun Yat Sen has finally proven itself to be unworthy of the chinese people, as the military rule of the Kuomintang did not managed to prevent the nation from falling victim to brutal Civil Wars and widespread anarchy. Resentful, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept the reformation of a Chinese Monarchy, but as it's control over the land is ambiguous, there are options of who is up to take the Dragon Throne."
monarchyoverhaul.21.a:0 "What do we do now?"
monarchyoverhaul.22.title:0 "Fate of the Dragon Throne"
monarchyoverhaul.22.desc:0 "Source of divine imperial power, the Dragon Throne has seen many individuals, dynasties and usurpers trying to achieve it. Many of those were successful military leaders, wise conqueror kings or strong figures, to which the heavens granted their mandate. Now, as the Empire forced itself into restoration, it's now to be chosen who will take the throne. Relatives of the last Qing Emperor, his father and brothers, still alive, could grant the restoration of the Great Qing if Puyi is to be brought back to China or not. As for alternatives, the Marquis of extended grace was once considered to take the throne, as a Han Chinese, instead of a Manchu. The sons of Yuan Shikai, proclaimed Emperor are also alive and could laid the basis of an Empire under the republican foundations. If bold enough, Chiang Kai-shek himself, could take the Throne as well, creating a new Empire that would appease the opposition to the Republic while keeping it's ideals, but that would mean recognizing the Warlordist state China finds itself in..."
monarchyoverhaul.22.a:0 "Bring back the Emperor"
monarchyoverhaul.22.b:0 "Only the heir of the Ming could reclaim the throne."
monarchyoverhaul.22.c:0 "The legacy of Yuan Shikai shall not be forgotten"
monarchyoverhaul.22.d:0 "The Emperor fought for the Kuomintang"
monarchyoverhaul.23.title:0 "China invites Puyi to retake the Dragon Throne"
monarchyoverhaul.23.desc:0 "Having it's childhood as a prisoner of the forbidden city, Emperor Puyi was deposed during the Xinhai Revolution, as a 5 years old. His father, Prince Chung, acting regent managed to keep his safety for a living inside the walls. He would be briefly restored nominally in 1917, and expelled from the Forbbiden City in 1924. Puyi had a deep desire to be restored to the throne he thought to be rightfully his, what lead to his collaboration with the Japanese and eventual installation of him as Kangde Emperor in the Manchurian occupation zone of Japan. In China, coups, bloody civil wars and an endless military rule finally collapsed, forcing the restoration of the Empire. Today, through a spy, Puyi was invited to retake the throne in China, with major conditions of constitutional rule to be restored. However, even if he accepts it, the Japanese wouldn't let him go so easily, while declaring his realm to be part of China would cause War with the Japanese. Therefore, it's either war or a really risky escape attempt."
monarchyoverhaul.23.a:0 "The Emperor is no puppet of the Japanese invaders! The Restoration will be whole!"
monarchyoverhaul.23.b:0 "Puyi must flee"
monarchyoverhaul.23.c:0 "The son of heaven won't accept such outrageous demands!"
monarchyoverhaul.24.title:0 "Puyi refuses!"
monarchyoverhaul.24.desc:0 "Through a spy, the chinese government officially invited back former Emperor Puyi to retake the throne while he is in Manchuria, ruling as a puppet of the Japanese. With everything decided, though, rethinking about the alternatives to Qing rule isn't a good idea. The Imperial family, however, isn't entirelly under japanese dominion. His father and former regent, Prince Chung could take the position, as he did before, also being one member of the Imperial family to accept the revolution, what assures us that won't be any problems. His brother, Pujie is the heir apparant to the Aisin Gioro House, also one of the best options for a replacement, we just have to choose."
monarchyoverhaul.24.a:0 "Regency with Prince Chung"
monarchyoverhaul.24.b:0 "If the Emperor betrayed us, he's dead to us!"
monarchyoverhaul.25.title:0 "Puyi Returns!"
monarchyoverhaul.25.desc:0 "Since 1932, former Emperor Puyi has been exiled in Manchuria, cooperating with the Japanese, but being a mere puppet of them. He nominally ruled the State of Manchukuo from 1934 as Kangde Emperor, hoping to one day return to China. As the Monarchy was restored, the chinese Government invited the Emperor back to the throne, which he accepted and fled Manchukuo back to China, enraging the Japanese, but also coming back to his people, whom all under heaven shall be ruled by it's son."
monarchyoverhaul.25.a:0 "Long live the Emperor!"
monarchyoverhaul.26.title:0 "Manchukuo surrendered it's lands to China"
monarchyoverhaul.26.desc:0 "The Empire of Manchukuo, formely State of Manchukuo, was created in the wake of the japanese invasion of Manchuria. The State was supposed to be independent in name only, as it was set to be the beginning of a Japanese imperial sphere out of the ashes of China, dismantling in the hands of warlords. Asking to be restored in case of a japanese conquest of China, the last Qing Emperor, Puyi, came to us and was installed as Manchukuo's Emperor to legitimize the existance of the State. China, however, surprised the world with the collapse of it's young Republic, giving place to the old Empire, hoping to get back on it's feet and reclaim lost territories. Puyi was invited back to China, what lead him to declare the reintegration of Manchukuo to China, forcing the Japanese army in the region to flee to Korea as the chinese military quickly crossed the border. Japan lost almost all of it's investments in the region, what easily could justify a War against China, but if we let go, minor concessions would certainly happen..."
monarchyoverhaul.26.a:0 "They WHAT?! This means War!"
monarchyoverhaul.26.b:0 "We can't afford a war like that now. Make the negotiations worth it..."
monarchyoverhaul.27.title:0 "Puyi fled to China!"
monarchyoverhaul.27.desc:0 "Installed as Emperor of Manchuria by us in 1934, Puyi, the last Emperor of China, was kept under strict supervision of the japanese military in the region to ensure the continuation of the puppet state. As events followed, the chinese government, fractured and in shambles, declared the restoration of the Empire. By what we know, they quickly invited Puyi to retake the throne, as we feared. He didn't gave anyone a public nor open response, only to go missing the next day, leading us to believe he is now being escorted to China, abandoning the Manchurian State. The consequences of this are disastrous, as the claim of China to Manchukuo couldn't be stronger, while no formal replacement for him was made, undermining the legitimacy of Manchukuo's existance, threatening japanese interests in the region."
monarchyoverhaul.27.a:0 "Find him now!"
monarchyoverhaul.28.title:0 "The fate of Manchukuo"
monarchyoverhaul.28.desc:0 "With Puyi ruling China from now, japanese grip on Manchuria is fading away, as the international recognition was already low. If the Emperor is both Xuantong ruler in China and Kangde in Manchukuo, nothing would stop China from claiming the land for it's own. To counteract this, Japan may have to resort to desperate measures. Installing Prince Yasuhito as a reformed Manchurian State is an option, though it would be almost a display of direct japanese control in a territory that's technically not ours nor recognized by the international community. We could also abolish the Monarchy and handle the Government to Wang Jingwei in an attempt to appease international tensions, faking a true Chinese Government, but losing our posessions in the region as well, but preventing the rising Empire in the south to reclaim it."
monarchyoverhaul.28.a:0 "Give it to Prince Yasuhito"
monarchyoverhaul.28.b:0 "Wang Jingwei must overthrow the Qing. Again!"
monarchyoverhaul.29.title:0 "The Mexican Empire"
monarchyoverhaul.29.desc:0 "When Mexico achieved it's independence, revolutionaries rushed to the only nobleman within the lands to be made Emperor. Initially, Mexico planned on installing a Personal Union with Spain if the three guarantees were to be mantained. The Mexican Empire was short lived, however, after the intervention of the French in the region, Maximilian von Habsburg was made Emperor of a puppet regime that shortly fell apart in the ongoing Civil War. On the minds of the Mexican people, the only Monarchy they could have a deeper connection with is the one that ruled during colonial times rather than the ones that existed during independence. As the Monarchists gained ground to enforce a third attempt, it's up to Mexico to decide which Dynasty will take the Crown. Maximilian I passed on his succession rights to the heirs of Agustin I, merging with Dona Maria Josepha being the sole heir to the throne. Some say, however, that the rightful succession falls uppon Archduke Felix of Austria, as his Brother cannot take the claim. Looking to Spain as well, it is unknown if any pretender to their throne would accept a mexican crown as well. We could decide on crowning the titular Empress, inviting the Archduke or a member of the House of Bourbon, sealing the ties with Spain planned since the beginning. There is, however, one single alternative if none of these can take the throne."
monarchyoverhaul.29.a:0 "The line of Iturbide is the only possible choice."
monarchyoverhaul.29.b:0 "The lineage of Maximilian should be strictly followed, despite his attempts to change it."
monarchyoverhaul.29.c:0 "A member of the House of Bourbon must take the throne"

monarchyoverhaul.30.title:0 "The House of Moctezuma-Tultengo"
monarchyoverhaul.30.desc:0 "Even before the first spanish set foot on the territories we know as Mexico, an Empire existed on the same lands and with unequal might. The Aztecs, as they became known, ruled the central mexican region for ages. Thanks to the spanish, though, their Empire was made into pieces. The last Emperor, Moctezuma II, surprisingly left us a living lineage that could be found to this day. Queen Isabella II of Spain recognized the title of Duke of Moctezuma in 1865, leaving to us a better track of where his descendants went. Today, the Duke is known as Don Fernando, direct descendant of the long gone Aztec Emperor and his Empire. If Mexico considers going back to it's indigenous roots, the Emperor of Mexico could be the one that carries the past on it's blood."
monarchyoverhaul.30.a:0 "No candidate could claim the throne of Mexico in such perfect way."
monarchyoverhaul.30.b:0 "What a ridiculous idea. Back to the candidates."
monarchyoverhaul.31.title:0 "The Kingdom of Poland"
monarchyoverhaul.31.desc:0 "The history of Poland isn't a newborn one. It's roots can be traced back to year 1000. Since then, a number of events and alterations happened within the nation, also laying the fate of the Crown. In 1795, the last remnants of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were carved by neighboring powers. Napoleon Bonaparte briefly restored an independent Poland as the Duchy of Warsaw; as the Congress of Vienna later recognized the existance of a Polish Kingdom in Personal Union with Russia that quickly was integrated into the Empire, only to be restablished in 1918 by the German Empire in the polish territories held by them in Russia. This Kingdom was short-lived, although many candidates were considered to take it's crown. A Hohenzollern, Habsburg, Wettyn or Polish Nobleman was to be chosen and installed as King of Poland. The reasons to choose one or another were many, but nothing came of it. As of right now, the same options remain, considering the Slachta was present in the formation of the first Kingdom, they're equally available now, but still we are left to choose."
monarchyoverhaul.31.a:0 "The Wettyn must rule again"
monarchyoverhaul.31.b:0 "A Polish King must rule"
