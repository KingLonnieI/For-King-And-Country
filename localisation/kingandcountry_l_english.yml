kingandcountry.1.desc:0 "When the Japanese Empire finally stood triumphant in the second Sino-Japanese War, the reorganized government got to be lead by the collaborationist Wang Jingwei, a successor to the entire legacy of the Chinese Revolution, both in the former Kuomintang and the early Republic. Following the Revolution, however, a short-lived attempt to mantain the Monarchy in China was made when chinese leader, Yuan Shikai, declared himself as Emperor of a new Empire of China. He was supported by some warlords, but the attempt was unsuccessful in the end and Shikai had to step down, dying shortly after. Now, with the Japanese Empire taking power in mainland China, the best option can be the installation of a puppet Government with the Empire restored, but as the maintenance of Manchukuo and a partitioned China to keep Japan as the main Power of the region, the last Qing Emperor, Puyi, is to be kept in Manchukuo and should not be restored to the mainland. On the other hand, a close friend of Jingwei is Yuan Keding, Shikai's eldest son and heir to Imperial Throne. If Japan is interested in a solution to the claim of the Manchu dynasty in Beijing, the Empire to be restored there can follow up the steps of Yuan Shikai, appeasing the Chinese who will be kept in touch with the Xinhai Revolution."
