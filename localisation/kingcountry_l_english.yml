kingcountry.1.title:0 "A Union that couldn't last"
kingcountry.1.desc:0 "Following the rapid and complex turn of events, the Monarchy was restored to Brazil after almost 50 years since it's end. It happened, however, through the force of arms of the rising Portuguese Empire, a nation that also saw the demise of it's Republic in recent years, which culminated in the restoration of the Kingdom under Dom Duarte Nuno, the Duke of Braganza. \n After Manuel II died, many monarchists agreed to recognize the miguelist branch of the Royal Family, despite it being ilegal since the banishment law in the XIX Century. The Rise of Duarte happened due to the lack of will of the King, dead in 1932, to restore the Crown by force, what displeased many monarchists, turning to Duarte to reclaim the Kingdom from the Republicans.\n His reign started ambitiously, with the intervention in the Brazilian Civil War, support in the Spanish Civil War and the reunification with Brazil to form the United Kingdom of Portugal and Brazil, sparking a succession crisis. With the incorporation of the brazilian realm into Portugal, it's citizens were made portuguese citizens and vice-versa. Careless, the Brazilian Emperor and the King agreed to unite both nations, thus making the brazilian line senior to the claim of Dom Miguel, forcing the King to or step down and let the Portuguese Empire be absorbed by Brazil or to enforce it's rule over brazilians. Diplomatic and peaceful solutions, until now, have failed, ultimately leading to the local authorities to declare independence from Lisbon, making the Union a short-lived attempt that also influenced the remaining lands to sever their ties with Lisbon. Powerless to react, the African territories and the many others across the seas left, as the King now must face a domestic crisis, considering if War will be well recieved."

kingcountry.1.b:0 "The Portuguese nation shall wage War across the globe to keep it's rightful Empire!"
kingcountry.2.title:0 "A Força Expedicionária Brasileira"
kingcountry.2.desc:0 "With the reunification of Brazil and Portugal, both lusitanian nations saw their destiny shift in a surprising scale, to say the least. The organization of this Lusitanian Empire, however, saw no glory, but fear and concern about the stability of the domains of Portugal and the future of the recently restored Monarchy. Negotiations with the Brazilian representatives lead the portuguese authorities to take careful steps in integrating the Brazilian Empire back into portuguese rule. Concessions were made to ensure brazilian autonomy and prevent the Empire from seceding again, before the Union with Portugal could be consolidated like it happened in 1822 with brazilian independence under Crown Prince, Heir, King and Emperor, Dom Pedro I and IV.\n Despite the high cost Portugal had to assume, it seems that such concessions to the Brazilian Dominion over the Atlantic are now beginning to pay off, as the local Brazilian Government organized a special division to be integrated into a larger imperial army for all the Lusosphere. Called the \"Brazilian Expeditionary Force\", the FEB relieved the central imperial government of much of it's weight in paying and mantaining troops across the seas, as brazilians and portuguese now join forces to strenghten the Empire they're now part of."
kingcountry.2.a:0 "Wonderful!"
kingcountry.3.title:0 "The German Nation"
kingcountry.3.desc:0 "Throughout the thousands of years of existence, the now solidified German Nation has existed as a collection of separate Kingdoms, Duchies and Principalities that once composed the Holy Roman Empire. After the latter's dissolution in 1806, it was up to the Confederation of the Rhine and later the German Confederation to carry on any link between the borders in the center of Europe. In 1871, after defeating it's neighbors in a meteoric rise, the Kingdom of Prussia grew to take control of many nations of german culture into a single Empire that soon rivaled Britain, France and Russia. Following it's defeat in the Great War, the world started to see Germany as a threat, while in the other hand, the Kingdoms of old, displaced by the same blow that put an end to the Kaiserreich, it should be considered by our foreign policy if every people living inside the remains of the German Empire should be kept under it's rule or the realms that once constituted the body of the Reich are to be considered nations on their own right."
kingcountry.3.a:0 "If War with Germany is inevitable, we must make sure the nations within are liberated."
kingcountry.3.b:0 "The Germans have made a nation of their own, it must kept intact."
kingcountry.4.title:0 "The Crown of Spain"
kingcountry.4.desc:0 ""La Corona de España" can be said to make reference to either the Spanish Monarchy, started with the Catholic Kings, or the historical institution that the collection of realms in the iberian peninsula would eventually constitute. The Spanish Empire was far more based on this institution, "The Crown of Spain", than on an unified nation. Aragon, Castile, the other kingdoms within the iberian peninsula and the other domains across the New World and the Globe were united only by Madrid and the King himself until the modern era, when the historical regions were dismantled by the Central Government. Not being hard to say that every event in spanish history after their empire's collapse is a direct or indirect result of the independence of Latin America, the unity of Spain itself with it's significant minority groups, ethnicities and historical borders not being fully integrated show how fragile the idea of a "Spain" still is, specially now, as the Monarchy that build the nation over itself is now gone. As a permanent policy of ours, should we consider that the nations within deserve a nationality of their own or support a strong Spanish State still on it's first steps to make an image of it's own?"
kingcountry.4.a:0 "The Crown never had the right to destroy constituent kingdoms in the first place."
kingcountry.4.b:0 "The Unity of Spain goes beyond the union of the Catholic Kings."
kingcountry.5.title:0 "African Civilizations"
kingcountry.5.desc:0 "Long before the Europeans found Africans in a tribal stage of society, the continent of Africa had been a birthplace of many Empires and complex civilizations that still catches the eyes of the modern world into understanding such \"strange\" way of living. By the ending of the XIX Century, European Powers managed to carve the continent to grow their vast Colonial Empires into the Industrial Age. \n Claiming the \"White Man's burden\" is a legitimate justification for taking control of African lands, tribes and peoples, the process of "Civilization" is understood by the world to be taking place, despite many atrocities and destruction that happened with their rule in foreign lands of the Continent. Many Colonial Powers have installed some form of indirect rule so they could either legitimize their dominion to the locals or annex already existing Kingdoms that had nations of their own. It is undeniable that Africa and Asia must have a change of course from the Colonial order that now rules over them. If we are to see an independent Africa, based on the borders of previous civilizations, should we push for the continuation of the process of civilization, but having an european royal to take charge or let the Kings within take their place and evolve together as a society?"
kingcountry.5.a:0 "Africa deserves the right to self-determination and the recognition of it's traditional rulers!"
kingcountry.5.b:0 "The Royalty of Europe shall carry on the Civilization process on an independent Africa"
kingcountry.6.title:0 "Are you playing other mods?"
kingcountry.6.desc:0 "This mod, as said before, praises for max compatibility, but even this can lead to minor conflicts or some campaigns that, playing alongside other mods, may get a scenario that makes no sense. If your campaign is being played with other mods not properly adapted to get the Monarchist Ideology, you may get this event to allow you manually convert to Monarchism if your Non-Aligned leader is meant to be a Monarch and is get from another mod's event, Focus Tree or decision. If that is the case, this event will unlock a decision in the decision tab that, when activated, will set your leader and ideology to Monarchist. Have in mind that it can't predict if it's a Dictator or Monarch, the decision will appear if your nation is non-aligned and this option is unlocked by you, manually. If you're playing with a mod that does fit with this one, it is recomended that you keep the decision locked, as the game would be adaptable to minor situations without damaging your campaign."
kingcountry.6.a:0 "Yes, i am playing other mods"
kingcountry.6.b:0 "No, i'm not playing other mods or any conflicting mod"
kingcountry.7.title:0 "The Hungarian Monarchy"
kingcountry.7.desc:0 "Since it's independence from the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, Hungary have decided for retaining the Form of Government, but preventing the Habsburgs to take the Crown, as of the Union with Austria since 1867. The Kingdom of Hungary has been ruled by a Regency since, headed by Admiral Miklós Horthy, that have prevented the restoration of Karl IV twice, but along with Parliament, is yet to elect a King. It seems that the decision and times of instability came to an end and the nation is finally ready to elect a new monarch. Popular among the people, many would support the idea of making Horthy the King, what wouldn't be any absurd, but the popularity of the Habsburgs also remains huge among the population; however, their restoration could cause tensions with neighboring nations as many threats of war happened before, with the possible exception of crowning the Palatine of Hungary, a Habsburg, as the King. Another idea that came into consideration was to legitimize the claim of the children of Archduke Franz Ferdinand through his morganatic marriage, severing our ties with Austria, but having a Habsburg on the throne. Either way, the path is open to select a new Monarch from a range of options, that we are still to decide."
kingcountry.7.a:0 "We must decide this in time."
kingcountry.7.b:0 "The Election will be open and without preference"
kingcountry.7.c:0 "The Palatine of Hungary should take the charge"
kingcountry.7.d:0 "Let's turn to the Hohenbergs instead"
