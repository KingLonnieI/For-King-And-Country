The installation of a Monarchy in our lands was declared recently, however this country never had a figure that could claim a crown if not going back to foreign or colonial rule searching for one.

forkingandcountry.2.desc:0 "In 1804, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II proclaimed the formation, out of the Habsburg realms, the creation of the Austrian Empire as a response to the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor. The Empire would follow a troubled route in the XIX Century, being changed to Austria-Hungary when the Crown lands of Saint Stephen were elevated to equal status to that of Austria until it's dissolution in 1918. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was internally divided in many constituent Crown Lands that gained independence from both Cisleithania and Transleithanian parts of the Empire. What was left was the Archduchy of Austria to have it's capital in Vienna, along a carved Kingdom of Hungary as it's neighbor. Attempts to retain the Habsburg Dynasty, restore it or reunite the lands were made, but failed. Now, it was agreed that Otto von Habsburg, son of the last Emperor is to be restored to Austria, but the identity of the realm itself is subject to a difficult decision. If this new austrian monarchy is to be called the Austrian Empire, it would lay basis to a claim on the former lands what would certainly cause international outrage. If it is to be addressed as the Archduchy of Austria, it's prestige would fade away, but at least, the Great Powers would be inclined to accept Habsburg rule without threatening of effectivelly waging war on us."

Our country, however, is a young nation. The only contact that our people and history can make with the Monarchical regime is that of legendary figures or historical long gone realms, of which the rulers and descendants died a long time ago. The most recent rulers of nominal Kingdoms that our nations stood under are foreigners, in our case, the Habsburgs. Although nominally Kings of entities that would form our nations, the Crown Lands were far more a subject of the Austrian Empire than a nation in Personal Union. Now, with a monarchist fervour going to the point of restore the Crown in our territories, we have a choice: invite the Habsburg ruler to be our Monarch, choose a relative of him or elect a random noble that may fit our needs."

As many times before, a vacant throne was managed by the regency of a Congress, then electing a candidate, most likely of noble inheritance, citizen or not, to be it's Monarch. In our specific case, the colonial period saw the reign of three different dynasties, to which our people could relate much more than any ruling families of neighboring nations. Without a native candidate, the ruling Dynasties of our lands were the Trastamara, that died out in the early Spanish Empire, the Habsburgs, that ruled the realms of the Spanish Crown for 200 years, succeeded by the Bourbon, heirs to the spanish throne. Of those, we could choose a candidate of these Royal families to take the crown, as the head of any of these Houses could lead to an union with a foreign nation and deep resentment and unrest, what we cannot allow."

forkingandcountry.5.desc:0 "As our nation is still deciding over the fate of it's newly established Crown, many see a downside in it. Although the Monarchy is set, we may have to rely on foreigners to invite a candidate for our Monarch. Our colonial past is what all of us look to while deciding on which dynasty should be installed in Bolivia. An unusual, but perhaps good idea that came into being is that of recognizing the rule of the Afro-Bolivian Monarchy, informally installed within the nation, specially among the people of african descent, still looking to their past of freedom in the form of gathering around their 'King'. Many nationalist groups, indigenist movements and even those who oppose a Monarchy as a whole came to terms, agreeing that elevating the unofficial royalty inside would be a display of culture and that they would be happy with a native taking the position, or at least less opposed to the Crown itself."

forkingandcountry.6.desc:0 "Centuries ago, in 1532, the spanish conquistadors landed in the modern lands of Peru. The people that existed here, however, never called it by it's current name. Those were the Tawantinsuyu, a diverse gigantic society who held an Empire that ruled the Andes, now known as the 'Inca Empire'. The brutal conquest of the Inca so many years ago is still a deep wound in peruvian national history, specially among those who support the many indigenous peoples within and praise it's pre-columbian roots. The act of killing the Sapa Inca and it's heir doomed an Empire of millions with the hands of only 168 men. When the idea of making a Monarchy in our nation started to spread, many remembered this episode in fear of returning to a form of rule similar to the one that destroyed everything their ancestors built so long ago. Rebellions among the inca were frequent, and so was the spanish attempt to eliminate all of them. A man of name Francisco Chukiwanka Ayulo, prominant indigenist, is known to be a descendant of the last caciques in colonial eras. He is undeniably a member of the Imperial family of old and could be crowned as a Monarch, as an early plan during independence proposed to do; not only of Peru, but the whole south america as a revived Incan Empire."

forkingandcountry.7.desc:0 "With our realm currently in debate of who should be the new monarch of a crown that in fact was made from the ground, there's a common feeling of rejection of the invitation of a foreign Monarch to rule, while we don't have one of our own to even claim to be if the King of Spain himself, what wouldn't be accepted by anyone. One alternative, however, gained popularity very fast in discussions: Inviting the Duke of Veragua to take the crown. While electing a Grandee instead of a Royal wasn't the main idea, the Duke of Veragua was a title given to the descendants of Christopher Colombus, currently held by Ramon Colón de Carvajal. It would be symbolic, to say the least, to allow the descendant of the man who discovered a continent to be a King in what came to be of the lands that were found so long ago. As a Grandee himself, the Duke has no major ties to Royal families, what would avoid any trouble regarding our relations with them."

forkingandcountry.8.desc:0 "Just like the many other nations of Latin America, Argentina never lived under monarchical rule as an independent nation. However, Monarchy and Argentina had a pretty long history. The Liberator, San Martin, was a monarchist himself. He was one of the few who supported the Inca Plan, as well as debates over the Form of Government in Argentina and the possibility of a changing it to a Monarchy continued. A resolution to the War against the Brazilian Empire was considered to be the invitation of the Duke of Parma to not only be King of Argentina, but also marry a brazilian princess, solving the question of Cisplatina in the form of a dowry, but even with parliament's approval, it came to nothing, as the King of Spain again refused the acceptance of a member of his family to take a latin american throne. Also, by the late XIX Century, a french lawyer would claim the region of Patagonia, contested, but not occupied by Argentina nor Chile, to be an independent Kingdom. After the turmoil the Republican regime brought upon Argentina with bloody Civil Wars, coups and plaguing corruption for more than a century, a Monarchy was finally put in place officially in Buenos Aires. The fate of the Crown, however, isn't decided. What could be done is to recognize this prince as a sovereign and take a Monarch for ourselves and had no recognition, enforce the decision back in 1817 of bringing the Duke of Parma to rule the United Provinces, inviting a member of Orleans-Braganza so peaceful ties with Brazil would be strenghtened or stand by our previous, but provisional, decision and enforce it."

forkingandcountry.9.desc:0 "When the Revolution broke out in 1776, the British Parliament and the British Monarchy where two distinct sides of a single war against the americans. When King George declared the colonies out of his Royal Protection and the Parliament usurped the right to decide colonial affairs, the Monarchy of what would become the United States simply dissolved. It's early attempts of building a nation by cheer luck didn't degenerated into the instability the fell uppon the little Republics of Latin America. During the War, it was proposed to retain the King as a part of Government while expanding the authority of the Congress, making the USA the first Dominion of the British Crown. It was also considered to invite a Prussian Prince to take the Throne, which he refused, ending up with the creation of the position of President. Despite the evolution and solidification of a republican government in America, in these times of trouble and struggle between dangerous ideologies, a new front was oppened by 'monarchists'. They've proposed the installation of a Monarchy in America, that would retain the basic institutions of democratic and federalist america, while opposing the many threats and incompentency of the Government as it is. Although in consideration, it's a hard decision. Possible candidates could be former british monarchs, if any; Princes of Windsor or search for older rival claimants to the throne through the Jacobite or Plantagenet lines. A Personal Union, like Canada and the other dominions is also possible, but as well we could try again inviting a Prussian Prince or making a choice with all possible prestigious families we can find."

Edward of the House of Windsor recently married an american citizen, making him one of the most popular among the proposals, as we would retain a native as Queen. We can, however, either choose the younger princes or decide on relatives of the Royal Family that wouldn't turn our nation so dependent of the british, as a possible Personal Union is not popular, even among the most royalist of americans that now support the formation of a Crown in our lands."

forkingandcountry.11.desc:0 "As of today, the ruling House of the British Empire is the branch of the German House of Saxe-Coburg Gotha that adopted the name 'Windsor' following the Great War. As we know, the lineage of the british dynasties that came into being had split several times in the past, sparking Civil Wars, Revolts and internal opposition of some radical royalists that refuse to recognize the Windsors as the legitimate rulers of England. As the americans so think of, a Windsor on the Throne isn't the best option, therefore, we had to track other possible candidates related to the british throne but are still far away from it. The House of Saxe-Coburg Gotha itself now is, by law, split from the british succession, as well as the Jacobite claimant has no throne to rule. Aside from these options, there are descendants of the so old plantagenet dynasty that still live, as well as british peers that hold the succession by the Tudor line. Having such options in place, we can have an American Monarchy that held onto succession, but separated itself from the United Kingdom."

forkingandcountry.12.desc:0 "At first a laughable insane idea, soon became a serious consideration. Joshua Norton was a citizen of San Francisco that lost most of his fortune in a failed business during the XIX Century. He became notorious, however, when he proclaimed himself Emperor of the United States, later Defender of Mexico, in sympathy for the mexicans when the french invaded the country by 1863. As a charismatic figure, Norton made a reputation that was eccentric to say the least, as the city of San Francisco displayed large admiration towards the 'Emperor' and, out of dissatisfaction towards american politics of the time, supported his 'imperial acts'. Norton became a considerable option for the basis of a real american Monarchy as he had no noble ancestry, proposed many projects that ended up being made or were truly revolutionary by the time. As his relatives still live, the charisma of Emperor Norton incarnated the values of America if it were to have a monarch, those being of merit, honor and popular support. If his successors take the throne, the United States would have a non-noble citizen on the throne, cutting any ties with European Monarchies while making one of our own."

forkingandcountry.13.desc:0 "As soon as the Revolution began in Russia, Finland declared itself to be an independent nation. It's status within the Russian Empire was, technically, a Grand-Duchy in Real Union with the Tsar. When the independence was made, for a brief period, Finland recieved the support of the Central Powers during the Great War and eventually declared the formation of the Kingdom of Finland, electing Frederick Charles of Hesse to be it's King. The Prince, however, never got to reign, as the Central Powers lost the war and the presence of a german monarch would be unpleasant to the Great Powers of Europe. This lead to Regent Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim to accept a republican constitution, aborting the would-be Kingdom of Finland. As time passed, monarchist support grew in Finland enough to be considered the restoration or recontinuation of the Kingdom, allowing the King-elect to take the throne. The monarchists, however, split into three groups. One seeks to restore the King itself to the throne, others think that, as he renounced, his son should be installed as King instead, while others proposed that the regent, Mannerheim, was to be made the monarch or installed in a perpetual regency. Mannerheim is a noble himself, of swedish roots and a finnish citizen, even though he regards the Russian Emperors, Nicholas II in special, with great respect and sometimes appears to be more russian than a finnish. All three options are equally valid and the idea of a german king not creating any opposition at all after so long give Finland a confortable position to decide, but with the monarchists not coming to any agreement, it's up to the finnish parliament to decide the matter."

When the Russian Revolution took place, the state of affairs in Ukraine was also chaotic. The nation had a short-lived Government in 1918 that had a Cossack aristocrat in the country's command, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi. His rule was not only short, but also uncertain. It was not properly declared if the Hetmanate was a Monarchy or a military junta, despite having it's roots on both forms of rule. The Hetmanate was fiercely anti-bolshevik and the soviet takeover of Ukraine lead to it's dismantlement. Now, as an independent nation, monarchist support grew within the country, but the candidate itself remains unknown. As the Crown of Ukraine is already established, there are a few options to the issue. Assuming the Hetmanate as a Monarchy and placing Pavlo back into power, bringing back a member of the Romanov family, as russia remains under the soviet yoke or to openly elect a Monarch, considering a candidate within many possibilities."

As in many countries across the world, the ideals of monarchism gained prestige and widespread support.
