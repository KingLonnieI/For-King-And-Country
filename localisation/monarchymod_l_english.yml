monarchymod.1.title:0 "The Focus Trees"
monarchymod.1.desc:0 "This mod, as intended, praises for the most compatibility with other mods that may be used by the player. In order to reflect the paths of some countries in the game or DLCs that go through a Monarchist path, the focus trees had to be altered accordingly, just like national spirits, ideas, events and decisions. These may not be fully compatible with some mods, but they are loaded into the game on start, rather than replacing vanilla files. This event is made to you, player, to decide whether to add the altered focus trees, to load some of them or to load none, if you are playing alongside another mod that already does that. Be aware that the modded trees still mantain the leaders and results of monarchist paths in the neutrality ideology and that, if you load them, they will replace the trees the country is using, no matter if you are using a mod that gives a new tree to a country. In that case, you should load the trees manually in the decision tab that will appear to you in one of the options. Nations that the Vanilla game does not give a focus tree and get one through a mod, won't conflict with the result of this event and should work as normal, but in any case, ideas, events and decisions can conflict with the other mod content."

monarchymod.2.title:0 "On Continuing the Monarchy"
monarchymod.2.desc:0 "In the Americas, the canadian connection with the Monarchy began when the provinces joined together in Confederation to form the Dominion of Canada. Earlier plans and the fathers of the confederation itself wanted to have their granted Home-Rule to become a 'Kingdom of Canada', but this was turned down so relations with the southern United States could be mantained. Canada also saw the formation of the 'United Empire Loyalists' on it's soil when the american revolution came and the loyalists fled north, as well as fighting multiple times the yankees to keep these lands under the Crown. Recently, the hard decision of breaking complete ties with Britain and the King, Edward VIII, due to his negligence and irresponsibility with his duties as the monarch of a global empire had left us all but betrayed. The institution of the Monarchy, however, is something that, through the years, distinguished ourselves from the americans and the formation of an independent Kingdom, with our own King now unopposed, mantaining the Monarchy could be a way of enforcing canadian sovereignty if we are to keep the crown, but dispose the Dynasty. With such action, we could even keep the other dominions under a single Crown, dismantling the British Empire, but enforcing the bonds of all who left due to the outrageous royal actions. On the other hand, making a Republic is something that remains in touch with our history when remembering the short-lived rebellions of the XIX Century. The option is to debate whether or not the Monarchy is to be kept or abolished, considering that if a Canadian Kingdom is formed, the actions of the Monarch would be far more present than our current regime."

monarchymod.3.title:0 "The Kingdom of Canada"
monarchymod.3.desc:0 "Following the disastrous initial reign of British King Edward VIII and his marriage scandal crisis, the Dominions within the British Empire left and broke ties with the Crown. The aftermath of this unintentional, but no less enforced, dismantlement of the British Empire, the Dominion of Canada decided that the Monarchy within the nation is to be kept, not abolished. The Canadian Parliament, after this forced patriation, decided to pass a constitutional amendment that raises the status of the nation to a Kingdom and recognized as the root of the canadian monarchy, the father of Queen Victoria, making it legal for Canada to decide a monarch out of her lineage. Some have suggested that Prince Arthur, one of her sons and a former Governor-General of Canada, as well as the british king's uncle, take the throne in our lands, while others have suggested that we invite an elected candidate to the throne, making no distinction between any possible royals that are to be proposed and decided by the Parliament. Either way, the Crown of Canada and that of the other Dominions remains vacant, with this issue being the first the Kingdom of Canada still needs to deal with."

monarchymod.4.desc:0 "Following the aftermath of the constitutional crisis that echoes all across the British Empire, the Dominions effectivelly cut ties with the British Crown, rejecting Edward VIII as their shared monarch. Surprisingly, however, the Canadian Parliament after opting for this unusual patriation, decided that the Form of Government is to remain the same and the Parliamentary Monarchy is to be kept intact. To fufil this vacant throne, Canada decided to declare the formation of a Kingdom in place of the previous Dominion and to form a Regency council while the newly independent power of the Americas decides who shall wear the crown removed from Edward by the force of a national identity.\n Without a proper guidance, it's hard to know how the British Empire will react in order to challenge this. Options for a new monarch were many, but the Canadian Parliament still have it's eyes on Prince Arthur of Connaught, a son of Queen Victoria that remains a legitimate option for succession recognizing the lineage of Victoria as the point zero of the \"Canadian Royal Family\". \n One way or another, the process of electing a new monarch to fulfill the vacant throne is, at least in name, open and up to consider choosing a candidate among a long list of possible rulers."

monarchymod.5.desc:0 "The Dominions when decided to break away from the british rule were united by the bond of the Crown, as they shared the same monarch and the status of Home-rule granted to them and other territories within the british empire was not finished in most of them. As Canada has just elevated itself to a Kingdom and the Canadian Parliament is preparing to elect a new royal to take the throne of an american potential global power, the debate came to decide if the Kingdom of Canada is now the new leader of the Commonwealth or if the decision to mantain their Monarchy and empower the role of the Crown is something that is restricted to them only and the other Dominions must decide the same matter just as quickly."

With the insistence of the King to follow his marriage despite all opposition and the chain of events that followed and lead to all self-ruling territories breaking away, Canada have decided to continue the Monarchy with another monarch that they are to choose, elevating their status to a Kingdom of their own.\n This does not mean, however, that the other territories are now subject to this canadian throne and the parliament officially stated that they will respect the decision of the other Governments that have joined the Commonwealth of Nations on the matter of keeping or abolishing the monarchical form of Government. As we have not done it officially, whether to elect a new Monarch or abolish the Royal symbolism is what we are yet to decide."

Now, the indian subcontinent is home to a nation that has as it's only basis the Indian Royal Army and the many Princely States that comprised the British India. With order being mantained by indian troops, the Princes have decided to call upon the provinces and their territories to gather in congress to decide the fate of India. Many have argued that the nation can be held together and ruled by the already existing Chamber of Princes that would extend their rule to provincial lands. Some have supported the idea of mantaining the Chamber of Princes, but among them, electing one Prince to be, be it temporary or for life, \"Kaisar-i-hind\" or \"Emperor of India\", replacing completely the claim of the British Monarch to such title.\n This option, however, does not seem to be very popular within the army and the Princes themselves, as having an Emperor could be dangerous to their future, yet many argued in favor of doing so instead of having an assembly ruling an Empire in name only.\n Another possibility that raised was quite radical, but recieved the support of the military and to a significant degree, the indian people; that is to abolish the governmental structures of the British Raj and replace it with a Federated Republic, what although would make easier to integrate provincial territories, could cause turmoil and would cost the very existance of the Princely States."

The Muslim population within cannot hold their battle with the hindu majority in India and as a result, Pakistan was formed among the Provinces and Princely States on the islamic part of the nation.\n As soon as it took form, four options were put into debate to better represent the interests of the muslim population. One of them proposed that the heir to the Mughal throne, an islamic Empire that ruled almost all of India that now holds no lands, to be the Pakistani monarch. Others favored the election of a local Prince to further solidify the territory, to which two main options were made: the Nawab of Junagadh or the Nawab of Bahawalpur.

monarchymod.9.desc:0 "The history of modern Algeria dates back at least to the ottoman rule in the region, when many governors were assigned by the Ottoman Sultan to handle affairs until the French invaded and occupied the mainland. Without support from a declining Ottoman Empire, a short lived Sultanate made itself in Mascara as opposition to the French. Just like the nation, it's dynasty was also short-lived and although Algeria can link it's past to that nation and now pleads for a ruler, no candidate can be found. With this in mind, an unusual process in the islamic world must take place. Like europeans, inviting a foreign prince that mostly fits the national identity can be done as well; in that case, options aren't lacking, the Moroccan monarchy to the west, Tunisia to the east, as well as Libya and Egypt can provide us with a Prince of their own to lead an independent Algeria."

From then on, the Russian Domination would be the last to hold an islamic eastern part of the region on a tight grip. The Russian Empire and successor Soviet Union lost their control over these lands that were once held by the Persian Qajar Empire. The conquest of Azerbaijan by Russia meant the complete loss of control by Persians on a muslim majority region that distance itself from it's neighbors that have some connection with the House of Bragationi if they are to call a monarch to their lands. \n The situation in Azerbaijan could develop in two ways. Either a Qajar prince take the position of Monarch or the ruling body of this nation decides upon an european royal to better improve the status of Azerbaijan in the world stage and gain prestige from a distant Europe that may come to the aid of this struggling nation."

monarchymod.11.desc:0 "Attempting to appease the Constitutionalist clash with Miguelists, that have been revived by the reunification between Brazil and Portugal that sparked a full succession crisis as brazilians accused the King of Portugal of pressuring the unification onto the Brazilian Emperor through Military force. This action, in a surprising backlash lead to the legitimacy of the line being entangled once again, being the first time in 1826, following the death of Kingdom Dom João VI. The lineage of Dom Pedro, who briefly ruled as Pedro IV in Portugal and Pedro I in Brazil, died out with Manuel II, the last King; but lived on in Brazil, not only lived in contrast to the banished miguelist lineage, but also becomes it's senior, as the male heir of Pedro became Dom Pedro II of Brazil, not entering the line of Portugal and just as an exception has been made to allow the Miguelist branch to take the crown, many rallied to the cause that the pretense of Dom Pedro II to a portuguese throne could be made as well, making his now successor, the legitimate King.\n As opposition and overwhelming brazilian support to reject portuguese rule grows more and more, threatening the ruling of the Empire itself. The General Courts and Imperial General Assembly agreed to debate on an idea that is, to say the least, unusual. It was proposed that the last Queen, the wife of Carlos I and mother of Manuel II, take the Regency to enforce the legalization of the reigning monarch, but it is assumed that if done, Queen-Mother Amelia would pull some strings to place her favorite candidate. One way or another, this would please the constitutionalists no matter the result. Question is: Should we do it?"

The ultimate decision still rely on the assemblies, but the support of the regency left little ground to reject her choice. As she promoted the cause of one of the pretenders, the dynastic law shaped according to her actions, effectivelly making the Queen the real power to decide who is legitimate to take the throne of both the Kingdom of Portugal and the Empire of Brazil. \n For the relief of many, she did hear the many voices advocating separate causes without causing turmoil between the branches of the House of Braganza and did considered the outcome of every possibility, but in the end the decision was:"

monarchymod.14.desc:0 "Last of the male line of the Carlist claimant to the throne, the old Don Alfonso Carlos was dragged by the carlist cause to become a King or to guide the succession as he took the position childless and aging. Alfonso himself was far more moderate than the acting carlists, stating in many cases that he intends to recognize whoever is to succeed him if said heir is able to respect the Salic Law, the Fueros and regional rights. \n For the disgrace of Carlists, the next in line to both the Carlist and French Legitimist throne, as a descendant of Louis XIV of France is Alfonso XIII of Spain, deposed Monarch that ruled continually the isabelist line. Many of them refused to recognize Alfonso as the next Carlist King, despite this being the ultimate solution to the schism that happened long ago. \n To solve the matter, Alfonso appointed his nephew, Xavier of Bourbon-Parma to be the Regent of the Carlist cause. As many know, Xavier has no claim to the Spanish throne and couldn't be a King for Spain if the Carlists are to remain loyal to their original cause. To counteract this, four different options arose when the throne was restored: Acknowledge the claim of Alfonso and mend the schism with alfonsists; skip the line and recognize Alfonso's son and heir, Juan, as the new King; empower the national assembly to choose it's King despite all contrary measures to original carlist ideals or to give the crown to a Habsburg that holds matrilinial descent from Don Carlos I. \n If the Carlists decide to ignore the salic law, Alfonso Carlos' will and the legitimacy of action, the assembly can, indeed, pass the crown to Xavier, inaugurating a new dynasty in Spain. If they choose to recognize the Habsburg Prince that descends from Dona Blanca, a daughter of the previous claimant, the Duke of Madrid, they would be violating the Salic Law; however, many argued that this is different from the situation that lead to Isabella II to take the throne, as Dona Blanca never got to reign, but only transmit the claim to her descendants. What remains to be seen, is if such ideas are to be accepted and end the Regency of Xavier, as he was never a King."
