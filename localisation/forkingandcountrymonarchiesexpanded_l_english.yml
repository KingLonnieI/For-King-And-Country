forkingandcountrymonarchiesexpanded.1.desc:0 "The return of George II quickly had an impact on greek politics over the ashes of the second republic. His second reign, though, was no ultimate achievement of stability. Republicans, Communists and Radical nationalists still haunt the newly restored Monarchy. According to the circunstances of the position the King now finds himself in, a series of initiatives were made by the monarch to ensure Greece would soon be under a stable, but not necessarily democratic, order.\n The King laid the basis to the implementation of a dictatorial regime lead by the appointed prime-minister, Ioannis Metaxas. What's left to know is what's the role of the King in this new period of greek history; being Metaxas a loyal royalist worthy of the King's trust, we can question who holds the ultimate power in this political alliance."

forkingandcountrymonarchiesexpanded.2.title:0 "The spirit of 1862"
forkingandcountrymonarchiesexpanded.2.desc:0 "Long ago, 40 years after the Greek Revolution, the widespread insatisfaction with the King, Otto I, lead the people of this lands to carry on another rebellion that put an end to the reign of the first King and to Wittelsbach rule. The 1862 Revolution, however, is one that all greeks should celebrate due to it's symbolical meaning. The Monarchy installed in 1832 remained, but the Government and the people acted as one in the decision of making it so. \n The Revolution marked the beginning of the Glucksburg Dynasty, that remained in power until the second republic came into being. Now, restored to power, King George II is a controversial figure, that both brings the sympathy and revolt of greek subjects. Now, the order of the nation went in a different path, where the [GRE.GetRulingParty] is in charge. The highly nationalistic profile of the Government brought an idea that went along with republicans, nationalists and monarchists alike.\n Just like in 1862, a joint force of the nation could depose the monarchy and install a new dynasty. This time, however, a candidate of enormous force is planned to be the replacement. A Romanian Prince, Alexandru Cantacuzino, holds not only to noble roots, but also is a proven descendant of Byzantine Emperor John VI, along with the fact that he is member of a family that fought alongside the greeks in Constantinople itself by the time of independence. His involvement with the Iron Guard in Romania could be a matter of concern, but for many, it's a proof that he has the profile of this regime and is the one that will lead Greece to greatness."

POLITICS_ALEXANDRU_CANTACUZINO_DESC:0 "Member of the Cantacuzino family, Alexandru is a Romanian Prince that was involved with the actions of the Iron Guard. His past, however, couldn't be more linked to the idea of a Greater Greece that we all want to achieve. Descendant of a family that fought in Constantinople itself to liberate the Greeks during the revolution, the Cantacuzinos are also the only known family to be directly descendant of a Byzantine Emperor, John VI. As the new Basileus, he embodies the irredentism and glorious past of our national project."
