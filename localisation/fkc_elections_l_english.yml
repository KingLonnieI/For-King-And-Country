Likewise, we have decided that a Prince with strong ancestry worthy of a throne of ours is to be crowned in our lands."

The Regency of the Kingdom, set up by the occupying Germans was to elect a new monarch among it's options, that were likely to be a Hohenzollern or a Habsburg, while the Regency itself had Princes of polish nationality. Like that brief period, the Monarchy of Poland shall go back to it's roots and place a member of the widespread Slazchta on the polish throne."

 warlord_new_dynasty_mod_category_desc:0 "Many times before, generals or high-ranking officers within the Chinese Empire would rise up and take the place of corrupt ruler, ending ages of fading dynasties that lost the Mandate of Heaven to rule over the chinese people.

The people, however, still hold on to beliefs that once were the basis of a Heavenly rule. As our forces triumph over the political chaos of this nation and prove themselves that our leader has the right to rule, the final achievement may be the rise of a new Imperial Dynasty."

With many émigrés spread across Europe and the World, a variety of movements seeks to take their land back. In recent years, our nation made the first step by bringing a member of the Romanov Imperial Family to take the throne and lead subsequent campaigns in Russia until the Urals and Caucasus could be seen in the horizon. With the Soviet State meeting it's demise not long ago and a Romanov ruling the lands of the former Russian Empire, our nation is now capable to claim the legacy and identity of the latter."
 portugal_succession_crisis_mod_category:0 "The Portuguese Succession Crisis"
 portugal_succession_crisis_mod_category_desc:0 "In 1808, when Napoleon invaded Europe the portuguese Royal Family fled to Brazil under protection of the Armada and the British Royal Navy. After the defeat of Bonaparte, King Dom João VI elevated Brazil to the status of a United Kingdom in 1815. 5 years later, with the Oporto Liberal Revolution, the King was forced back from the capital in Rio de Janeiro to sign the first portuguese constitution, leaving behind his son and heir, Dom Pedro, to rule Brazil. The General Cortes of the time grew increasingly hostile to brazilian interests, attempting to force the reduction of brazilian autonomy. This sparked a nationalist movement that eventually lead to the independence of Brazil in 1822, with Prince-Regent Pedro being crowned Dom Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil. The Treaty of Rio de Janeiro in 1825 confirmed the nation's independence as well as entangled the branches of the House of Braganza when Dom João VI died in 1826 and both his sons couldn't take the throne in the strict understanding of the fundamental laws of realm. Dom Pedro I was briefly made King Dom Pedro IV of Portugal as the Cortes thought to be best. Knowing he couldn't allow Brazil and Portugal to be united once again, he abdicated in the name of her daughter, Queen Dona Maria II, that would marry her uncle, Dom Miguel to ensure that a portuguese dynasty would continue. In an ilegal act, Miguel took the throne for himself, sparking a Civil War in Portugal that happened to be won by the Brazilian Emperor after he abdicated the Crown of Brazil in the name of his son, Emperor Dom Pedro II. Being the heir, the lineage of Pedro continued to rule the Kingdom until 1910, when Manuel II was deposed. Childless, the latter was the last descendant of Dom Pedro IV through Maria II. Many monarchists of the time decided to turn on the miguelist claim, that was made ilegal and the branch of the family banished from Portugal forever. Despite this, Dom Duarte Nuno, the miguelist descendant was recognized as the Head of the House of Braganza. In Brazil, following the republican coup that overthrew Emperor Dom Pedro II, the two branches went on to be different dynasties, but as both the Kingdom of Portugal and Empire of Brazil were restored in recent years through force of arms and the careless decision of both monarchs to reunite Portugal and Brazil made both Royals equal citizens of Portugal, making the Brazilian Emperor a senior to the King, that not only had an ilegal claim from the start, but also entangled the dynasty yet again as Dom Pedro II of Brazil was to succeed his father in Portugal as well if both nations remained united. This succession crisis now threaten both nations as support formed towards Dom Pedro Henrique of Orleans-Braganza and anti-miguelist sentiment only grows. If this newly restored United Kingdom is to last, either the political effort must be enormous to keep the succession as it is or it may mean the end of the short reign of Dom Duarte."

 cisleithania_mod_category_desc:0 "Cisleithania was the Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire that was formed when the Dual Monarchy came into being. Comprised of the Crown lands of Bohemia, Galicia, the Archduchy of Austria and many other duchies, Cisleithania was the center of what was once called \"The Austrian Empire\". Now that the nation controls these lands again, the recreation of the Austrian Empire is possible and our main goal to achieve."
 cisplatina_empire_mod_category:0 "The Empire of Brazil"
 cisplatina_empire_mod_category_desc:0 "Being part of the Spanish Empire as well as the Portuguese and conquered by Brazilian troops in 1816, the region known as Uruguay had a difficult time establishing itself as a nation. When the decision of installing a monarchy in uruguayan lands, many remembered that the only link Uruguay had with a Monarchy was either by the Spanish rule or the independent Empire of Brazil, that held on to the Province of Cisplatina until 1828 after a War with Argentine to keep control. Considering this, the national congress have decided the the heir of the Brazilian Imperial Throne, defunct since 1889, should take the crown of our lands. If order is restored to the colossus of South America, the Empire that created it can be made anew."

For centuries, the Holy Roman Empire, although having an elected Emperor, the position was successfully gained by Austrian Archduke and the Habsburg Dynasty. Now, as Austria followed a separate path from that of Germany, the Habsburgs were not the rulers of a German State as they had been before, however, the restoration of austrian rule to those lands that are no longer under the rule of the Prussian Kaiser, the basis of a continental empire are in place."
