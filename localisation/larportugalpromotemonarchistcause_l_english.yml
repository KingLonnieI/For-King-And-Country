larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.1.title:0 "As Dificuldades de um Império Luso-Brasileiro"
larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.1.desc:0 "Written by Silvestre Pinheiro Ferreira during the times of the United Kingdom of Portugal, a series of essays, books, letters and suggestions by the portuguese author already discussed what could be said to be the 'Dificulties of a Luso-Brazilian Empire'. In these notes, Ferreira states that a massive Empire like the one envisioned by the King could only work with massive reforms in the monetary, political and military areas of administration. In his studies, the author also suggests that operating this Empire would require the central government to recognize the real separation between the two nations, each one with it's own chamber, government and beaurocracy, united only under the Monarchy, Army, Finances and Diplomacy, that were to be ruled by an imperial upper chamber instead of the one in Lisbon alone. Now, with the Kingdom reuniting with the former Empire, the advices of Ferreira are again put into discussion, as it's necessary to decide where Brazil stands within the United Kingdom."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.2.desc:0 "Set to be the Brazilian Parliament when the Imperial Constitution came into effect, the General Assembly held the legislative power within the Empire. It was, technically, abolished in 1889 to form the Brazilian Congress in the new Brazilian Republic. As the Monarchy was restored, the imperial assembly could act again with a series of initiatives of Prince Dom Pedro Henrique that prevented the disintegration of the brazilian congress. With the reunification with Portugal, the assembly has a lot to do in order to restablish the Empire that existed before according to the needs of the United Kingdom."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.3.desc:0 "The Cortes Gerais was the name of the portuguese legislature during the Monarchy. It played a major role during the existance of the United Kingdom of Portugal and was one of the reasons of brazilian independence in 1822. In 1910, when the Republic came into being, it was replaced by the Congress of the Republic and it's successor legislative bodies. With the restoration of the Monarchy and reunification with Brazil, the highly different chambers of two realms ruled apart of each other opened up the possibility of reworking the Cortes Gerais into an Imperial higher chamber in a tricameral model of administration, leaving the two lower chambers to be separated in each constituint Kingdom, but having the ultimate authority to decide the matters of the Empire as in order to further solidify the union with Brazil it's necessary to decide the affairs concerning both realms."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.4.desc:0 "Historically, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves had the capital in Rio de Janeiro until the Liberal Revolution forced it to return to Lisbon in 1821. As the place of Brazil within the Empire is still being worked out, placing the imperial capital in Rio could be a way of gaining the sympathy among the brazilian people and strenghtening the basis of the Monarchy itself, while appeasing some nationalist sentiment in the jewel of the crown, also gaining some power to bargain with the Imperial General Assembly to solve other issues the brazilians would most likely disagree with, while also considering that mantaining it in Lisbon is a way of making sure the Brazilian part of the realm does not overcome the sovereignty of the United Kingdom."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.5.desc:0 "When discussing the benefits of reunification between Brazil and Portugal, it was not made clear which Monarch would be the head of this newly restored empire. Prince Pedro Henrique knew and thought for himself that if the Brazilian Empire is to reunite with Portugal, he would be a portuguese citizen and a senior to Duarte in the line of succession, also being made King of Portugal, according to the laws of both countries. Dom Duarte, however, thought otherwise, as his wife, also a member of the brazilian imperial family, would confirm his place as head of this union, as succession laws aren't retroactive to overwrite his position as King. If this issue isn't dealt with, it may cause tensions between the two monarchs."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.6.desc:0 "In 1908, the brazilian republic was almost in it's 20th year and the head of the Imperial House of Brazil was the daughter of Dom Pedro II, Princess Isabel. The heir apparent of the Princess was Dom Pedro de Alcântara, that on that year, thinking a restoration in Brazil was unlikely, renounced his rights to the throne to marry a duchess of lower nobility, pressured by his mother. The headship of the imperial family passed on to his nephew, Dom Pedro Henrique, while his son, Pedro Gastão, stated that his renunciation wasn't necessary according to the laws of the Empire, a claim supported by lawyers of the time and some monarchists. As the restoration happened in Portugal and Brazil, the inheritance of the imperial family was again put into question due to the uncertainty in the line of succession of Portugal and the position of Brazil within the restored United Kingdom."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.7.title:0 "Revived Constitutionalist sentiment"
larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.7.desc:0 "'Constitutionalist' is a term used to describe the people who supported the forces of former King and Emperor Dom Pedro during the portuguese Civil War that lasted until 1834, as well as the claim of Maria II and her descendants to be the rulers of Portugal. After the last King, Manuel II, died without issue, the lineage traced all the way back to King John VI, dividing the legitimacy uppon three branches, the brazilian branch, the miguelist branch and the said constitutionalist branch. According to the portuguese constitution and the laws that followed the Civil War, the miguelist branch was excluded from succession and Dom Miguel, the usurper, was banished from Portugal along with all his descendants. This 'banishment law' is technically still in effect, while the heir to the miguelist branch, Dom Duarte Nuno, took the Crown as no alternative candidate could be found when the lineage of Queen Maria II died out with Manuel. The restoration of the monarchy and reunification with Brazil laid the basis of a brazilian claim on the throne, a colossal backfire of the King's actions to enforce reunification with Brazil, as it's former Emperor now precedes the King on the rights of succession. With the legitimacy of Duarte slowly fading away, many monarchists and brazilian revanchists are rallying to any alternative that may overwrite the miguelist claim to the chieftainship of the House of Braganza."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.8.desc:0 "As the succession crisis continues, an idea from a small group of loyalist groups suggested that the wife of Dom Duarte, Dona Maria Francisca of Orleans-Braganza should be the one to take the throne. Although she has no proper claim, it's possible that the family may come to terms. Through renunciation, agreements and finally, the abdication of the King, she may get to wear the crown. The idea came into being due to the fact that Maria Francisca is a member of the brazilian Imperial family, daughter of the most senior living descendant of Dom Pedro I and IV, that is also a candidate to the throne. Being 'half legitimate' in both ways, Dona Maria Francisca could appease both brazilian revanchists and miguelist supporters, as her ties to Duarte keeps both nations under a close supervision of both sides."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.9.desc:0 "With a short, but ambitious and historical reign, Dom Duarte Nuno, the first portuguese monarch since the restoration stepped down of the throne, as his envisioned projects had as collateral damage the loss of the crown itself. Reunification with Brazil, a golden opportunity for Portugal at first, ultimately lead to the colossus of south america absorbing the lusosphere more than returning to it. In order to assure the union would remain, however, it was a necessary action, as now the legacy of the King may endure and further solidify the cracks opened by a century of disunity."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.10.title:0 "Plans for the Empire"
larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.10.desc:0 "When the unification of Brazil and Portugal was agreed, suspicion was widespread about how much this 'agreement' was forced or not due to the portuguese military intervention in the Civil War that restored the brazilian monarchy. Accepting without resistance the portuguese proposal damaged severely the popularity of the brazilian Emperor, unless he was planning something... Ideas for this unification varied, considering total integration of Brazil in the Empire is impossible and was the reason of it's independence in 1822. One idea suggested that Brazil was to be made a subnational monarchy, like the Kingdoms within the German Empire functioned, but that would give Brazil much more autonomy than we actually intend to give. Another idea stated that the Empire should be run like a Confederation, however this could lead to a backlash, as Brazil would most likely absorb the portuguese realm instead of unifying with it. A final proposal was radical and would demand much of the assembly... The plan is to form a Lusitanian Empire and to acknowledge a true unification, meaning that if Brazil is the dominant force, Portugal should simply accept this and if the succession must put the crown in Pedro's head, so be it. One way or another, if Prince Pedro was planning something to gain with such deal, it's still up to the assembly to manage Brazil's place within the Empire, recognizing it's autonomy if Portugal intends to keep the lands it restored and not face a full out brazilian rebellion that certainly would overwhelm the nation."

larportugalpromotemonarchistcause.11.desc:0 "As for the sake of this Union to be kept over all the lusosphere, the Portuguese General Cortes have caved in to brazilian interests more and more, as an attempt to exploit the benefits of unification with Brazil following their Restoration, also backed by the portuguese. The General Assembly in Rio sent to Lisbon a demand: The United Kingdom is to be ruled by Prince Dom Pedro Henrique. Their argument is that, as the banishment law is still into effect widely in the Kingdom and the senior line of the House of Braganza now lies with the brazilian branch according to the fundamental laws of the realm and the unification implies that brazilians now have portuguese nationality, what makes the Orleans-Braganza branch the legitimate one either way. At the cost of changing the monarch so quick following the restoration, the Cortes need to cave in or at best, negotiate some more favorable concessions."
